Write a program in C# that:
Given multiple text files will count the occurrences of each unique word in the files and
aggregate the results. Processing of the data should be done in a way to minimize running
time and memory, independent of the number of files or file size.

For example, consider two files:
File 1: containing the text “Go and do that thing more that you do not so well”
File 2: containing the text “I do many things very well”
 
Considerations: File size can differ and can be large due to many words on one line or many
lines in a file. 

Note: You should demonstrate the principles of SOLID, Clean Code and Testability of code
in your proposed solution.
